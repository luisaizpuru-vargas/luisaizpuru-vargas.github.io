    <p>After completing my PhD I intend to transition to the private sector and pursue a career in data center planning and management. 
        The ubiquity of artificial intelligence will have profound implications for areas such as transportation, energy, healthcare and 
        science. There will be an exponential growth on the demand of cloud services as well as on the training and inference of 
        A.I. models. Data center infrastructure will play a critical role in this process. 
        The market size of data centers is expected to be $500 billion USD by the year 2030. 
        The opportunities to transform our economies and our quality of life are limitless. The future looks bright.</p>

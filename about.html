    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and having long conversations with the many international friends I have made throughout the years. I also enjoy moderate calisthenics. 

A particular hobby of mine is history. In particular, I am interested in 20th century history. The two topics I am most fascinated by are:
	
    • The ideological struggles between fascism, communism and democracy.
    • The origin and nature of the Cold War.


I speak four languages:

    • Spanish (Native Fluency)
    • English (Very High Fluency)
    • Portuguese (High Fluency)
    • German (Moderate Fluency)
